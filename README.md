# Definition of Efficiency
An algorithm is efficient if it has a polynomial running time.

# Stable Matching Problem
`perfect match`: A set of edges M is a perfect matching if every node appears in exactly one edge of M. 


A match S is stable if it is perfect and there is no instability with respect to S. 

There exists a stable matching for every set of preference lists among the men and women.

# Greedy
## interval scheduling (maximum with a single resource)
The most obvious rule might be always select the available request that starts earliest, but this method does not yield an iptimal solution.   
requires the smallest interval of time, it still can produce a suboptimal schedule.   
### optimal solution: accept first the request that finishes first

## interval partition(schedule all the requests using as few resources as possible with many resource)

# Network Flow
A broad range of network flow problems could be reduced to the max-flow problem. 
## Maximal Flow problem
This problem describes a situation where the material from a source node is sent to a sink node. The source and sink node are connected through multiple intermediate nodes, and the common optimization goal is to maximize the material sent from the source node to the sink node.  

The cost of the flow is at most the capacity of the cut.

### Fordâ€“Fulkerson Algorithm
the most common way to approach the max-flow problem in polynomial time is the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (FFA).  
`essentially a greedy algorithm `  
starts from an emptyflow and, as long as it can find an augmenting path, improves the current solution using the path  
(1) find an augmenting path  
do a depth-first search  
(2) compute the bottleneck capacity  
(3) augment each edge and the total flow  
# Approximation algorithm 
How should we design algorithms for problems where polynomial time is probably an unattainable goal?

### Load balancing problem

## pricing method (primal-dual technique)

## linear programming and rounding

## using dynamic programming on a rounded version of the input

## Randomized Algorithm
